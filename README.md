# Project:SSH-log-analysis-using-Splunk
# Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze SSH authentication logs to detect:
1. Successful logins (who connected, from where)
2. Failed login attempts (possible brute-force or password spraying)
3. Multiple failed authentication attempts (indicators of brute-force)
4. Connections without authentication (potential scanning or incomplete sessions)
